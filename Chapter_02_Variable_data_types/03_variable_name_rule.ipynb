    "## Now we will see the variable naming rules\n",
    "### 1. Variable can contain only letters(A-Z | a-z), numbers(0-9), and underscores (_).Example:\n",
    "        - student_name=\"Burhan_Zulfiqar_123\"\n",
    "        - student-name=\"Burhan-Zulfiqar-123\" | This will give error because of hyphen(-)\n",
    "        - student_name_1=\"Burhan_Zulfiqar_123\"\n",
    "        - studentname$=\"BurhanZulfiqar123\" | This will give error because of dollar sign($)\n",
    "### 2. Spaces are not allowed in variable name but underscores(_) can be used to separate words.Example:\n",
    "        - student_name=\"Burhan_Zulfiqar\"\n",
    "        - student name=\"Burhan Zulfiqar\" | This will give error because of space\n",
    "### 3. Avoid using Python reserved words or keywords as variable names.Example:\n",
    "        - class=\"Math\" | This will give error because class is a reserved word\n",
    "        - def=\"my_function\" | This will give error because def is a reserved word\n",
    "        - student_class=\"Math\" | This is correct\n",
    "        - function_name=\"my_function\" | This is correct\n",
    "### 4. Varable name should be descriptive and meaningful.Example:\n",
    "        - x=10 | This is not descriptive\n",
    "        - student_age=20 | This is descriptive\n",
    "### 5. Becareful with case sensitivity. Variable names are case-sensitive.Example:\n",
    "        - StudentName=\"Burhan\" | This is different from studentname\n",
    "        - studentname=\"Eric\" | This is different from StudentName\n",
    "### 6. Variable name should not start with a number.Example:\n",
    "        - 1st_student=\"Burhan\" | This will give error because it starts with a number\n",
    "        - student1=\"Eric\" | This is correct"
